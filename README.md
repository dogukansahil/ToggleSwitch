# Toggle Switch: Dark and Light Mode Transition
This project features a simple toggle switch that allows users to switch the theme of a web page between dark and light modes.

## Features

- **Persistence**: Remembers the user's previously set theme mode preference when the page loads.
- **Visual Feedback**: Indicator on the toggle switch depending on the current theme mode (Sun ðŸŒž and Moon ðŸŒ™).
- **Responsive**: Automatically hides the switch on mobile devices (below 768px).
- **Storage**: Saves the user's theme mode preference to local storage when changed.

## Usage

You can directly use the code by adding it to your web page. You can determine if the dark mode is active by checking the classes of the `body` tag.

## Preview

Upon loading the page, you'll see a toggle switch on the top right corner. You can use this switch to change the theme mode between dark and light.
